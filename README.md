## ðŸ“¢ Notes

- Slash commands may take a few minutes to register globally after the bot starts, that's why we are using DEV_GUILD_ID
- Ensure you invite the bot with the correct permissions:  
  - `applications.commands`
  - `bot` permissions to read/send messages.
- Make sure you have Message Content Intent enabled on [DISCORD DEV PORTAL](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
